# How-does-Ayuh-Fertility-Centre-offer-personalized-fertility-treatments-

Ayuh Fertility Centre believes that fertility care should never follow a one-size-fits-all approach. That’s why they focus on personalized fertility treatment tailored to each patient’s unique condition, history, and goals. From the very first consultation, Ayuh takes time to understand the root cause of infertility through thorough diagnostics, hormonal evaluations, and lifestyle assessments. Based on this data, a customized treatment plan is designed, which may include IVF, ICSI, IUI, egg donation, or even fertility preservation.

The centre also adapts treatment protocols during the cycle based on how the patient responds, ensuring higher success rates. For example, if a woman doesn’t respond well to stimulation medication, adjustments are made in real time. Emotional and psychological support is also integrated into care plans to make the experience as stress-free as possible.
